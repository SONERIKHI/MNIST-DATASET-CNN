MNIST Dataset CNN
This repository contains a CNN model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

Introduction
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. The images are 28x28 pixels in size, and each image is labeled with the digit it represents.

A CNN is a type of deep learning model that is well-suited for image classification tasks. CNNs work by learning to identify patterns in images, and then using these patterns to classify the images.

Dependencies
This repository requires the following Python libraries:
numpy
matplotlib
keras

Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 99.85% on the training set and 98.62% on the test set.

Discussion
The model is able to achieve a high accuracy on the MNIST dataset because it is able to learn to identify the patterns in the images that correspond to each digit. However, the model is not perfect, and it can sometimes make mistakes. For example, the model might misclassify a 7 as a 9, or a 3 as a 5.
